Arbitrary Large Integer libarary
implemented by Devin Dooley for Grinnell CSC282
...and personal use of course.

##Design choices
The majority of header files are based upon the "Arbitrarily large integers"
and "Parsing integers" musings cited below. Functions were renamed at will for better
clarity and to help myself with implementation. In addition, an int indicating 
the sign of the integer was added to the ALInt struct, instead of basing it upon
the sign of the first integer.
